SECURITY AUDIT REPORT - CultureQuest Web Application
================================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
-----------------
This Flask-based challenge submission system contains multiple CRITICAL and HIGH severity security vulnerabilities that require immediate attention. The application is currently in an insecure state and should not be deployed to production without significant security improvements.

TECHNOLOGY STACK
-----------------
- Framework: Flask 3.1.1 (Python)
- Database: SQLite3 (file-based)
- Frontend: HTML with Jinja2 templating, TailwindCSS
- File Uploads: PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- Dependencies: Flask-WTF, WTForms (installed but not implemented)

CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES
========================

1. NO AUTHENTICATION OR AUTHORIZATION (CRITICAL)
   Location: All endpoints (app.py)
   Description: The application has NO authentication mechanism whatsoever. All functionality including:
   - Challenge submission (/)
   - Admin screening interface (/screening)
   - Status updates (/update_status/<id>/<status>)
   - Challenge deletion (/delete/<id>)
   
   Impact: Anyone can access admin functions, view all submissions, modify challenge status, or delete challenges.
   CVSS Score: 9.1 (CRITICAL)
   Recommendation: Implement proper authentication and role-based authorization immediately.

2. EXPOSED SENSITIVE API KEYS (CRITICAL)
   Location: .env file
   Description: The .env file contains exposed API keys:
   - VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY=2344922e00f5fd32e8d0fa057552a3a549ae40aae5284ada7aa71c5f6b648459
   - GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyAUCV4hav0Puc_baG577YAsHjaFEelKnnU
   
   Impact: API keys are committed to version control and accessible to anyone with repository access.
   CVSS Score: 9.8 (CRITICAL)
   Recommendation: 
   - Immediately revoke and regenerate these API keys
   - Add .env to .gitignore
   - Remove from git history
   - Use environment variables or secure key management

3. NO CSRF PROTECTION (HIGH)
   Location: All forms (challenge_form.html, screening.html)
   Description: Despite Flask-WTF being installed, no CSRF tokens are implemented. All state-changing operations are vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
   
   Impact: Attackers can trick authenticated users into performing unintended actions.
   CVSS Score: 7.1 (HIGH)
   Recommendation: Implement CSRF protection using Flask-WTF tokens in all forms.

4. CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING (XSS) VULNERABILITIES (HIGH)
   Location: templates/screening.html:24-26, 44
   Description: User input is directly rendered without escaping:
   - {{ challenge.name }}
   - {{ challenge.email }}
   - {{ challenge.description }}
   - {{ challenge.status }}
   
   Impact: Stored XSS attacks possible through malicious challenge submissions.
   CVSS Score: 7.4 (HIGH)
   Recommendation: Enable auto-escaping or use |e filter for all user-controlled data.

HIGH VULNERABILITIES
===================

5. INSECURE DIRECT OBJECT REFERENCES (HIGH)
   Location: app.py:20-23, app.py:25-37
   Description: Challenge IDs are directly exposed in URLs without access control:
   - /update_status/<int:id>/<status>
   - /delete/<int:id>
   
   Impact: Users can manipulate any challenge by changing the ID parameter.
   CVSS Score: 7.5 (HIGH)
   Recommendation: Implement proper access controls and validate user permissions.

6. DEBUG MODE ENABLED (HIGH)
   Location: app.py:40
   Description: Application runs with debug=True, exposing sensitive debug information.
   
   Impact: Debug pages can leak sensitive application details and stack traces.
   CVSS Score: 6.9 (HIGH)
   Recommendation: Set debug=False in production and use environment variables.

MEDIUM VULNERABILITIES
======================

7. UNRESTRICTED FILE UPLOAD (MEDIUM)
   Location: challenge_form.py:30-41
   Description: While the application checks for PNG format, vulnerabilities exist:
   - Files saved with original filename (path traversal risk)
   - No file size validation beyond Flask's MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH
   - No filename sanitization
   - Uploaded files served statically without content-type validation
   
   Impact: Potential path traversal, file system pollution, or malicious file execution.
   CVSS Score: 5.8 (MEDIUM)
   Recommendation: 
   - Sanitize filenames
   - Generate unique filenames
   - Validate file headers, not just extension
   - Serve files with proper content-type headers

8. INSUFFICIENT INPUT VALIDATION (MEDIUM)
   Location: challenge_form.py:16-19
   Description: Form inputs lack proper validation:
   - No length limits on description (only HTML maxlength="1000")
   - No email format validation beyond HTML5
   - No phone number format validation
   - Name field accepts any string
   
   Impact: Data integrity issues, potential DoS through large inputs.
   CVSS Score: 4.9 (MEDIUM)
   Recommendation: Implement server-side validation for all inputs.

9. INFORMATION DISCLOSURE (MEDIUM)
   Location: templates/screening.html:25
   Description: Email addresses and phone numbers are displayed in admin interface without proper access control.
   
   Impact: PII exposure to unauthorized users.
   CVSS Score: 5.2 (MEDIUM)
   Recommendation: Implement proper access controls and data masking.

LOW VULNERABILITIES
==================

10. MISSING SECURITY HEADERS (LOW)
    Description: No security headers implemented (X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, etc.)
    Impact: Clickjacking and other client-side attacks possible.
    Recommendation: Implement comprehensive security headers.

11. NO HTTPS ENFORCEMENT (LOW)
    Description: No HTTPS redirection or HSTS headers.
    Impact: Data transmitted in plaintext.
    Recommendation: Enforce HTTPS in production.

12. SQLITE DATABASE PERMISSIONS (LOW)
    Location: challenges.db
    Description: Database file may have overly permissive file system permissions.
    Impact: Potential unauthorized database access.
    Recommendation: Set appropriate file permissions (600).

POSITIVE SECURITY FINDINGS
==========================

1. SQL Injection Prevention: Parameterized queries are used consistently (app.py:32, challenge_form.py:59,72,79)
2. Limited File Type Validation: Only PNG files are accepted for uploads
3. Dependency Management: Requirements.txt lists specific versions

IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS
=====================

1. IMMEDIATELY disable debug mode
2. IMMEDIATELY revoke and regenerate API keys in .env
3. Implement authentication and authorization
4. Add CSRF protection to all forms
5. Fix XSS vulnerabilities by enabling auto-escaping
6. Implement proper access controls for admin functions
7. Secure file upload functionality
8. Add comprehensive input validation

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRODUCTION
==============================

1. Use a production WSGI server (not Flask dev server)
2. Implement proper logging and monitoring
3. Use PostgreSQL instead of SQLite for production
4. Implement rate limiting
5. Add comprehensive error handling
6. Implement backup and recovery procedures
7. Regular security testing and code reviews
8. Implement SSL/TLS properly

RISK ASSESSMENT
===============
Current Risk Level: CRITICAL
The application should NOT be deployed to production in its current state.
Estimated time to secure: 2-3 weeks with experienced developer.

Report Generated: Security Audit
Methodology: Manual code review, static analysis
